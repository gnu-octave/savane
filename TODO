Database upgrade
================

- The database content is UTF-8, but is still declared latin1. That's
  why there are alignment issues when reading query results via the
  command line interface. This also leads to mis-sorting when
  manipulating strings with accents. The database update could
  redeclare the database fields as utf8 while not altering the content
  itself. There's a way to do so with MySQL but I don't have the
  commands under the hand.
