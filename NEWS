  set accordingly.

  "$sys_appdatadir/trackers_attachments")

* The behavior of SCP changed somewhere between OpenSSH 5.2 and 5.5
  (inclusive).  It now passes an extra '--' argument before the copy

[DATABASE STRUCTURE]

  Savannah, there are now ~17000 files totalling >400MB, which becomes
  inconvient to handle (huge dumpfiles, etc.). The migration script
  stores files in /var/lib/savane/trackers_attachments by
  default. Files are named after their file_id, to avoid naming issues
  (duplicates, security, simplicity, etc.)


[DEVELOPER NOTES]

* Code compatible with PHP5

* Cleaner PHP code (less warnings, allowing to look for real issues)

* More secure input validation (prevents SQL injections and CSRF);
  works with register_globals=off and magic_quotes=off.

* Test Savane on http://localhost:50080/ with single line:
    make -C tests/minimal_configs/

* Build system based on autoconf & automake, plus MakeMaker for the
  Perl library

* Full UTF-8 database (including declarations and ordering)
