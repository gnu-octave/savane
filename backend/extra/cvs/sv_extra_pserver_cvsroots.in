# This script should be used via a cronjob to update the system
# by reading the database about groups.
#
# It will add create/update a group for each group.
# It will also create a download area, a web area, and a cvs repository
# if in the database the fields dir_cvs dir_homepage and dir_download
# contains the string %PROJECT
# (if they don't, it means that no group specific directories like that
# are desired).
# (the web area can be also a cvs repository
#
# Note that each group on savannah got two groups: $group and web$group.
# The first one to manage the source repository, the second one to
# manage the web repository.
#
# WARNING: sv_groups should run before sv_users.
# WARNING: this script will only care about groups in A status.
#      deleting groups should happens rarely and be handle by an admin
#      that will have to decide whether deleting the group from the
#      database is enough or not.
